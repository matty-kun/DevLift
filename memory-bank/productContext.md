### Scenario 1: Student Project Discovery
Sarah is a computer science student looking to gain practical experience. She logs into DevLift, browses available projects filtered by her skills (React, JavaScript), and finds several interesting opportunities. She reviews project details, founder profiles, and expected outcomes before applying to three projects that match her interests and availability.

### Scenario 2: Founder Project Posting
Michael is a startup founder who needs help building a mobile app. He creates a project on DevLift, specifying required skills, estimated time commitment, project goals, and what students will learn. He reviews applications, conducts brief video interviews, and selects two students to collaborate on his project.

### Scenario 3: Project Collaboration
Lisa is working on a UI/UX project for a startup she connected with through DevLift. She uses the platform to communicate with the founder through external channels (LinkedIn, email) linked from their profiles. She receives feedback and tracks milestones through the DevLift platform while conducting detailed discussions externally.

### Scenario 4: Portfolio Building
David has completed three projects through DevLift. He uses the platform to showcase his contributions, including descriptions of his role, technologies used, and outcomes achieved. He includes these portfolio items in his resume and shares them with potential employers, who can view verified testimonials from the founders he worked with.

### Scenario 5: User Type Selection
