# DevLift Project Brief

## Project Overview
DevLift is a web platform that connects student developers with startup founders to collaborate on real-world projects. The platform aims to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical experience for students, while providing startups with access to talent for building their products.

## Core Objectives
1. Create a platform where students can find real-world projects to work on
2. Enable startup founders to find talented students to help build their products
3. Facilitate project-based learning and portfolio building for students
4. Help startups accelerate their development with student talent
5. Create a community of builders and innovators

## Target Audience
- **Students**: Computer science, design, and other tech-related students looking for practical experience
- **Founders**: Early-stage startup founders who need technical help but have limited resources

## Key Features
- User authentication with distinct user types (student/founder)
- Project listing and discovery system
- Application and selection process
- User profiles showcasing skills and experience
- Project tracking and status updates
- External communication facilitation

## Technical Requirements
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Supabase for authentication and database
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Dark theme with custom color scheme (cyan, purple, orange accents)

## Success Metrics
- Number of active projects on the platform
- Number of registered students and founders
- Project completion rate
- User satisfaction and feedback
- Portfolio growth for students
- Development acceleration for startups

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core authentication, user profiles, and basic project listing
- **Phase 2**: Project application system and improved discovery
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced profiles, project tracking, and community features
- **Phase 4**: Analytics, recommendations, and advanced matching

## Constraints
- Initial focus on web platform (mobile app to be considered in the future)
- External communication tools instead of built-in messaging system for MVP
- Limited resources for marketing and user acquisition

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast loading times and responsive UI
- Secure handling of user data
- Scalable architecture to support growth
- Accessible design for all users
