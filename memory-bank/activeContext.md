# Active Context: DevLift

## Current Focus
We are currently implementing the core features and enhancing the user experience for DevLift. The focus is on:

1. **Project Discovery System**: Enhancing the Projects page with search, filters, sorting, and pagination
2. **Authentication System**: Refining sign-in and sign-up flows with user type selection
3. **User Interface**: Developing a consistent dark theme with custom accent colors
4. **Protected Routes**: Ensuring authenticated access to sensitive pages and features

## Current Work Focus
Recent changes include fixing footer positioning in src/App.tsx, resolving white screen issues by removing animation code, and ensuring responsive layout for the Projects page.

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced the Projects page with comprehensive features:
  - Added search functionality for finding projects by title, description, or skills
  - Implemented filters for skills, difficulty, and duration
  - Added sorting options (newest/oldest)
  - Implemented pagination with "Load More" functionality
  - Added loading states and error handling
- Protected routes for authenticated users:
  - Projects page is now accessible only to authenticated users
  - ProjectDetails page is now protected
  - Profile page is protected
- Improved UI components with custom colors and transitions:
  - Enhanced buttons with color transitions (200-300ms)
  - Added custom cyan accents to icons and interactive elements
  - Improved form inputs and filters
- Fixed navigation from Hero section to Sign-up page with user type highlighting
- Enhanced the Dashboard page with user-specific cards for recommended projects, applications, and quick links, including conditional rendering and loading states.
- Successfully started the local Supabase environment, but encountered errors with authentication tests due to invalid login credentials.
- Updated tsconfig.json and package.json to handle TypeScript issues, and added a testAuth function in src/lib/supabase.ts for in-app testing.
- Paused backend testing to update the Memory Bank.
- Attempted multiple tests for Supabase authentication, including creating and running test scripts, but faced persistent errors with TypeScript file extensions and invalid credentials.
- Edited package.json and other files to resolve issues, and provided guidance on creating a test user in Supabase Studio.
- Removed fade-in animation and scrolling effects from src/index.css to fix rendering bugs.
- Adjusted App.tsx for Flexbox layout to keep the footer at the bottom.
- Addressed PostCSS errors in src/index.css by cleaning up comments and unnecessary code.

## Active Decisions

### User Type Implementation
We've decided to store the user type in both:
1. Supabase Auth metadata (for quick access during authentication)
2. A separate user_profiles table (for more detailed user information)

This approach provides flexibility while maintaining performance for authentication flows.

### UI Design System
We're using a dark theme with three accent colors:
- Cyan (`#19c3f7`): Primary accent for interactive elements
- Purple (`#7b2ff2`): Secondary accent for special elements
- Orange (`#f74a19`): Tertiary accent for calls-to-action

The background is pure black with various gray tones for cards and other UI elements.

### Project Discovery Approach
For the Projects page, we've implemented:
- Server-side filtering (simulated for now) for optimal performance
- Client-side search for immediate feedback
- Pagination to prevent overwhelming the UI with too many projects
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### Communication Strategy
For the MVP, we're focusing on external communication rather than building a messaging system. Users will be directed to external platforms (email, Slack, etc.) for communication.

## Next Steps
- Verify that all UI elements are rendering correctly without errors.
- Test the app for any remaining layout or scrolling issues.
- Proceed with further development on core features like project browsing and user profiles.

## Known Issues
- White screen errors have been mitigated, but monitor for any recurrence.

### Immediate Tasks
1. ~~Complete the Projects page for browsing available projects~~ ✅
2. Implement project creation flow for founders
3. Create the project application system for students
4. Add form validation and error handling to all forms
5. ~~Implement protected routes for authenticated users~~ ✅

### Upcoming Features
1. ~~Project search and filtering~~ ✅
2. Enhanced user profiles with portfolio showcases
3. Application tracking for both students and founders
4. Skill matching algorithm for project recommendations
5. Analytics dashboard for founders

## Current Challenges
1. **User Onboarding**: Creating a smooth onboarding experience for both user types
2. **Project Creation**: Designing an intuitive project creation flow for founders
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Continuing to refine UI for all device sizes
4. **Data Modeling**: Finalizing the database schema for projects and applications
5. **Authentication Edge Cases**: Handling account verification, password reset, etc.
6. Authentication tests are failing with 'Invalid login credentials'; likely due to user creation or configuration issues.
7. Ongoing TypeScript configuration errors in the terminal, such as 'Unknown file extension .ts', despite updates to tsconfig.json.

## Technical Considerations
1. Using React Context API effectively for state management
2. Optimizing performance with appropriate component memoization
3. Implementing proper error handling for API calls
4. Ensuring consistent styling across the application
5. Managing form state and validation with React Hook Form 

## Next Steps
- Verify and recreate the test user in Supabase Studio, then retry authentication testing in the app.
- Integrate and test the testAuth function directly in the app to avoid terminal issues.
